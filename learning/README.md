## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Read code alongside chapters** - Keep `main.go` open and jump to referenced line numbers
2. **Try modifications** - Change values, add features, break things (safely) to learn
3. **Practice exercises** - Each chapter has hands-on exercises
4. **Build on top** - Once you understand the basics, try adding new features
